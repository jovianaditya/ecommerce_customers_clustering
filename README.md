# E-COMMERCE CUSTOMERS CLUSTERING

E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the activity of electronically buying or selling of products on online services or over the Internet. E-commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems. E-commerce is in turn driven by the technological advances of the semiconductor industry, and is the largest sector of the electronics industry.

In this project, I'm making simple descriptive model using K-means algorithm that clustered supermarket customers into multiple group to help marketing team develop suitable marketing strategies which is expected to have an impact on increasing revenue for the company.
